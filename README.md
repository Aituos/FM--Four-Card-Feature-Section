This is my first HTML/CSS project from the Frontend Mentor website (not my first project in general, I've been practicing for some time now). It's also my first time using Git and GitHub. To be honest, setting up Git, understanding it and making it work - on its' own and in VSCode - was a headache. I ran into a lot of problems and Stack Overflow was used heavily lol. Everything is fully operational now (I hope) and this repo is my first practical experience with using Git and GitHub.
